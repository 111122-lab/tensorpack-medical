# Anatomical Landmark Detection

Automatic detection of anatomical landmarks is an important step for a wide range of applications in medical image analysis. In this project, we formulate the landmark detection problem as a sequential decision process navigating in a medical image environment towards the target landmark. We deploy multiple Deep Q-Network (DQN) based architectures to train agents that can learn to identify the optimal path to the point of interest. This code also supports both fixed- and multi-scale search strategies with hierarchical action steps in a coarse-to-fine manner.
